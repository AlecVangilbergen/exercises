# Explanations

Download [your group schedule](rooster.ucll.be) for an entire year as an iCal file.
Write a script that reads the file and computes how many hours you spent
with each lecturer. Print the results as a list sorted in descending order.
You can run the solution on an `.ics` file to view what output is expected.

```bash
$ python solution.py schedule.ics
```

You might want to rely on the `ics` python module. It is not installed by default,
so you will need to [find a way](https://pypi.org/project/ics/) to install it.
